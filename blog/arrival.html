            Recently I watched the 2016 sci-fi movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)">Arrival</a> and was hit with sort of 
            a profound question. <b>Spoiler alerts if you haven’t seen the film!</b><br><br>

            The premise: Twelve imposing alien ships resembling monolithic obsidian ovals land on Earth. One enters from the bottom, with a tall 
            shaft above one’s head. Upon reaching a certain altitude, gravity shifts sideways allowing explorers to walk straight “up” 
            towards the top of the spacecraft, where they find a pair of curious, ethereal, 7-legged Cthonian creatures noticing their presence. 
            These Heptapods communicate via highly compressive circular palindromic symbols, and come to offer a gift to humanity in exchange for 
            aid 3000 years into the future.<br><br>

            The main character, Louise (Amy Adams) is a linguistics expert who experiences episodic memory flashbacks, which turn out to be both 
            personal and important for broader humanity. The latter memories offered key insights that accelerated our learning of the alien’s runes, 
            allowing readers to unlock some sort of non-linear perspective of time. The former showed flashbacks of her infant daughter being born, 
            her growing into adolescence, and then to terminal illness via a rare disease at age twelve. Later on she realizes her memories are not in 
            fact memories but premonitions of the future unlocked by the alien’s gift. Realizing her daughter was yet to be born, that Ian (Jeremy 
            Renner, her physicist colleague and unexpected companion) would be the father whom she would fall in love with and who would later 
            leave her for keeping her secrets about her premonitions, she asks “Ian, if you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you 
            change things?”
